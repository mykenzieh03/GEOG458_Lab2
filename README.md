### Please create a narrative based on your research. In your narrative, please describe the topic as well as the parameters you have used for search (5 PTS)
In the realm of urban development and dynamic landscapes of cities, the merging concepts like urbanization and new urbanism shapes the future of our urban future. My analysis begun by looking deeper into urban development to understand the ever-evolving dynamics of cities. I honed in on the the following keywords "urban development", "urbanization", and "new urbanism". These terms became the compass guiding my exploration into the conplexities of city planning, design, and emerging concept of urban living.
My search parameters focused on the importance of these keywords in discussions surrounding videos abut urban development. By using a word frequency analysis show key themes, with top words like "Urban", "city", "plan", "develop", "future", and "new" shaping the narrative. These words formed the backbone of this search, representing the fundamental elements that are contributing to the urban landscape.

### why do you want to make this comparison (5 PTS)
The decision to make this comparison between "urban development", "urbanization", and "new urbanism" comes from recognizing that they all have different perspectives and pathways of addressing urban challenges. Urban development has a historical context and has evolved over centuries, urbanization represents a demographic trend that has been ongoing for centuries and new urbanism is a response coming from challenges posed by conventional urban development. These three key words show a different perspective to the transformative nature of cities. These tree key words also address urban challenges, urban develop focuses on the challenges of infrastructure, housing, and economic growth. While urbanization raises questions about the rising population and new urbanism wants to address the issues that relate to the environment.

### compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds (5 PTS)
Some of the similarities between the three word clouds are the words "Urban", "Plan", and "City". Some differences I have noticed is that one emphasizes on new, design , and AI - while the other highlights words such as growth, history, rural, and migrating, and the first one is housing, change, and challenge. There are three themes among these word clouds, the first word cloud mentioning "housing"" and "change"" appears to be centered around the dynamic nature of urban environments that considers challenges and changes, particularly in the realm of housing. While the second word cloud mentioning "Ai" and "Design" shows a theme of innovation and modern approaches to ubran planning while the last word cloud encompasses a wider range of themes such as ubrna growth, historical elements and rural aspects.

### what might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed (5 PTS)
In the first word cloud, words like "Housing," "Change," and "Challenge" hints at a focus on taking on issues related to housing in urban areas. It seems like the purpose of this visualization is problem-solving, aiming to identify and address challenges within the realm of urban housing. The second word cloud, the presence of terms like "New," "Design," and "AI" suggests a forward-thinking and innovative outlook. It's possible that urbanization is to explore emerging technologies, design principles, and cutting-edge solutions in the field of urban planning. Lastly, in the third word cloud, the use of a broader range of terms such as "Growth," "History," and "Rural" indicates a more comprehensive approach. This representation appears to be focused on understanding urban development within a historical context, considering dynamics between rural and urban areas, and delving into the various factors influencing overall growth in urban environments.

### how your research could be improved in the future (5 PTS)
This research could be improved for the future by inviting stakeholder perspectives, by incorporating a diverse range of stakeholders such as city planners, residents and community leaders this will provide a well rounded view of those impacted by urban development initiatives. This also can be a temporal analysis to see how urbanization trends and planning have changed over time. This could also be a comparative global analysis, looking how different countries and regions implement urban policies and adapt to unique socio-economic and cultural contexts.

### anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you (5 PTS)
Something that stood out to me was the word "future", as city's and planners are always looking forward in terms of urban development and anticipating what lies ahead. With the combination of "new" and "urbanism" emphasizes the transformative nature to city planning.
